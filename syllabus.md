## Course Description
EOU Catalog Description:

> An introduction to the living primate populations of the world. Focus is on behavior, diet, physical characteristics, and lifestyle of human and non-human primates. Prerequisite: None, but anthropology and/or other social science courses strongly recommended. Student must have at least sophomore standing to register for this course.

\* Though humans will be considered, as we are primates, focus will be on _non-human_ primates.


## Required Texts
Required readings and supplemental resources will be made available in [Canvas](https://eou.instructure.com/login). **If you haven't yet used Canvas---or, even if you have and need help or additional resources---check out [EOU's "Student Resources for Canvas" page](https://www.eou.edu/lms/student-resources/).**


## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to do the following:

1. Identify the main physical characteristics that distinguish primates from other animals and how these may relate to things like behavior, diet, and locomotion.
2. Outline the basic taxonomic classification (subfamily or genus-level) among living primates, as currently understood, and some species within those groups.
3. In general, discuss the fossil evidence for the evolution of primates (e.g., earliest appearance, radiation of major groups, etc.).
4. Discuss variation in ecology (geographic range, habitat, diet, etc.) among the major groups of primates, citing specific examples.
5. Discuss variation in social behavior among the major groups of primates, citing specific examples.
6. Discuss challenges for the survival/conservation of wild, non-human primate populations today.


## Course Requirements and Grading
Requirements for this course include 3--4 quizzes, mandatory attendance/participation in the weekend session, and a short research paper.

- **Quizzes (20%)**:  These quizzes allow students to review background content provided in the weeks leading up to the weekend session. Students will take each quiz in Canvas. Quizzes will be timed at 60 minutes, and students may take each quiz up to two times (with the higher score recorded). Each quiz will be available Thursday (12:00 am) through Monday (11:59 pm) and due Monday at 11:59 pm.

- **Attendance/participation (50%)**:  __Attendance during the *entire* weekend session is *mandatory*.__ This statement cannot be overstated, as the University takes a hard stance on full attendance to receive credit for weekend-college courses. If a already student feels he/she may not make it to the weekend session, I advise him/her to drop this course. Barring a sudden, life-or-death emergency or traumatic event (e.g., death of an immediate family member), missing the weekend session will likely result in a failing grade. If one experiences some type of extreme event that allows an exception, the grade will recorded as an incomplete ("I"), and completion of the course will require submission of an additional research paper.

- **Research paper (30%)**:  Students are required to submit a research paper on a fairly-narrow, specific topic related to primates. The paper will be 7-to-10 pages in length (title page and bibliography _not included_). Topics must be submitted and approved by the instructor no later than the end of the weekend session. Students are advised to begin thinking of possible topics early and may submit possible topics to the instructor for approval at any time. More details on guidelines (e.g., general format and citing sources) and a rubric for the research paper will be given at a later date.


### Grading Scale

Grades for individual assignments (i.e., quizzes and the research paper) are assigned as percentages (calculated as points-earned/points-possible). The attendance/participation score is calculated by time present (i.e., was the student present for the entire session) and participation in any activities. Each student's final grade is calculated as a weighted average. All quizzes carry the same weight, and one's quiz average counts toward 20% of the final grade. The research paper accounts for 30% of the final grade. Attendance during the weekend session accounts for 50% of the final grade.

__Late Work Policy: Late work may be submitted up to 3 days after the due date. Late work is penalized at a rate of the point equivalent of one letter grade per day late. Any work submitted more than three days past the due date will not be accepted.__

Final grades are determined based on a basic, 10-points system:

| Letter grade | Percentage range |
|:------------:|:----------------:|
A | 100--90|
B | 89--80|
C | 79--70|
D | 69--60|
F | 59 and below|

## Course Outline
With a weekend college, there are relatively few dates to remember, other than the dates of the weekend session. Important dates are included in the Google calendar below. I will make a concerted effort to adhere to the schedule outlined here and will notify students of any changes/updates.
